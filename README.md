# WSAA-Courseware

Courseware for the  

This repository is about a Web services and Applications module, part of the HDip in Data Analytics ATU.

This repository will introduce various means of retrieving data from external sources (for example CSO, weather servers, stock information). Will look at the formats that data can come in (XML, JSON,CSV) and how you can retrieve (through an API) and process that data, using JavaScript and Python.

Will also explore how can make your own data available to the outside world by creating your own API (Application Programmer's Interface) using the python module Flask.
